Welcome folks, to the Emberginners install party âœ¨ ! Today we will focus on getting you ready for tomorrow's workshop!

## How to follow the workshop

What you're looking at now is a "Training Buddy" app. You will be able to follow along with examples that your presenter is showing you and find useful links to things you will need.

If you want to see the slides too you can follow along by clicking this link to the public slides [https://emberginners-install-slides.netlify.com/](https://emberginners-install-slides.netlify.com/). You can follow the slides and go back to previous lessons at any time, either during or after the workshop.

Do you have feedback or improvements for the workshop materials? Talk to us during the workshop and we'd be looking forward to incorporate your suggestion into the next edition of this project.
