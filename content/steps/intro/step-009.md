# An Intro to Ember

## What is Ember?

Ember or more specifically EmberJS (JS stands for **J** ava **S** cript) is a tool that helps you build entire websites using JavaScript. It itself is written in JavaScript and it provides different language patterns to you to make it more easy to manage your code and build your web app. It is also called a JavaScript **framework**, as it provides the foundation on which you can build up your own program.


Traditional websites from many years ago, used to be built on HTML and CSS only - two languages that have been used since the early days of the web. Many modern websites are mostly built based on JavaScript alone, using frameworks like EmberJS. JavaScript websites or so-called **web applications** gained popularity in the last years, since they can be viewed faster than traditional websites and using them feels more intuitive.

An example of a classic website is a news website such as [The Daily Mail](https://www.dailymail.co.uk) or [Tagesschau](https://www.tagesschau.de). These provide content for you to read but leave almost no room for interaction. Their main goal is presentation of information.

An example for a modern web application is a service like [Gmail](https://gmail.com) or [Dropbox Paper](https://paper.dropbox.com).
Features like your message editor or the message search integrate into the website smoothly and allow user interaction, which means they animate, provide you live suggestions for words you want to use as you're typing or highlight missing words without you having to reload the page.

When building web applications, the EmberJS framework supports you by integrating into JavaScript code seamlessly (and which you'll be writing to build your app).
Ember helps you to manage JavaScript files, allows you to edit them and run them in the browser. To achieve this, Ember will generate new JavaScript files for you on a few short commands, we will learn about later. The JavaScript files generated by Ember can then be modified further in your text editor to build your app.

The app we'll be building today will in the end look something like this:

In this section we'll learn some of the basic principles of Ember and how we can use an important tool - the Ember CLI (CLI stands for **C**ommand **L**ine **I** nterface) - to make building our application more easy.


## Installing Ember

Now that we have Node installed we can use `npm` to install `ember-cli`

```bash
npm install --global ember-cli
```

Alternatively, you can also use the following shorthand command to do the same:

```bash
npm i -g ember-cli
```

## Generate a new app project

In the following section you will learn about the [Ember CLI](https://cli.emberjs.com/release/). You will learn how to use it to

- create a new app project to get started with your application
- serve an EmberJS application from your own computer and see it running in your browser

### Exercise 2a: Generate an application

- Prerequisites: This step requires the Ember CLI to already be installed on your computer. You can check if it's installed by typing into your terminal: `ember -v`. If you see `ember: Command not found`, it means that Ember CLI is not installed on your computer. Please review the [installation instructions from the pre-installation step](#)
- Open your terminal
- Type in `cd ~/Desktop/emberginners-workshop` and hit enter to go into the correct folder to create your app in
- Type in `ember new super-rentals` and hit enter and investigate the console output. Wait until no new messages show up in your terminal

Here you can see all the files that make up the app. The Ember CLI created a new folder for us, called  `app` which alredy contains actual app code and where we will add our own code to create our first web application. You can ignore all the other folders like `config/`, `node_modules/` or `vendor/` today. In the end Ember will build the app that runs in the browser out of all these files that you can see here.

Once you have installed `ember-cli` globally you should navigate to the directory you want to put your ember app (remember our `cd` step to change to the right directory). Now that you're in the right place you can run `ember new` to crate your ember app:

```bash
ember new awesome-app
```

this will take a while to install all the dependencies.

Next up you just need to navigate into your new app using `cd` and run `npm start`

```bash
cd awesome-app

npm start
```

You can also use `ember serve` to start your ember app.

If all has gone well you can navigate to http://localhost:4200 to see the Ember demo app running.
