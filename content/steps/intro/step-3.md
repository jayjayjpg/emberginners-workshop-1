## What's a text editor?

> [A text editor is a program] to write code in. This could be a text editor (e.g. Visual Studio Code, Notepad++, Sublime Text, Atom, GNU Emacs, or VIM), or a hybrid editor (e.g. Dreamweaver or WebStorm). Office document editors are not suitable for this use, as they rely on hidden elements that interfere with the rendering engines used by web browsers.
