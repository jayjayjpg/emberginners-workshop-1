## What is a terminal?

A terminal is a program that allows you to run, stop and interact with programs on your computer using text-based commands. Other terms that are used to describe a terminal, are "console", "shell" or "command line". Each terminal window or terminal tab will open with a new line mentioning your username on your computer, your computer's name followed by an empty line Any program that you run via the terminal can be stopped and re-run.

To start a program or process you need to type in the respective command and hit enter, to stop a command use `Ctrl + C`. Throughout this workshop we will mention several commands that you need to run in the terminal.
