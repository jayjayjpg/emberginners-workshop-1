## How does this workshop work?

In this workshop you can learn more about web development and how to build your own websites.
It is meant for anyone who has little or no experience in programming yet and who would like to learn more about what programming is and how you can use this skill to create cool things on the web!

What do you need to do today and tomorrow to set yourself up for success?

- Keep an open mind
- Ask the mentors questions!
- Help each other out
- Take a break when needed
- Celebrate your successes today

Don't feel comfortable yet to get started coding on your own? Feel free to pair with one or two other people in the group. If you prefer working on your own, this is also great - see whatever works best for you!
