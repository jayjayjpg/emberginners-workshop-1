## What's a browser?

> A web browser, or commonly known as just **browser**, is a software application for accessing information on the World Wide Web. When a user requests a web page from a particular website, the web browser retrieves the necessary content from a web server and then displays the page on the user's device.

A browser allows us to visit websites on the internet, by creating a connection and downloading the required parts of the website to be displayed on our computer. Some browsers you might have used in the past are Firefox, Google Chrome, Internet Explorer or Safari.

To browse the internet, we use browsers on a daily basis. Chances are, that you already have one installed on your computer and mobile phone, too. To follow the instructions of this workshop as closely as possible, let's make sure that we have one specific browser installed on our machines: **Google Chrome**.


## Installing Chrome

Several browsers provide us with tools that help us to develop our web application. In the scope of this workshop we'd like to use **Google Chrome**. If you haven't got it on your computer yet, you can download and install it over [here](https://www.google.com/chrome/).
