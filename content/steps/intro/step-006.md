title: Installation Step 6 - Directories
order: 6
---

Create a drectory with your terminal using `mkdir` (which is used for <strong>m</strong>a<strong>k</strong>ing <strong>dir</strong>ectories)


```bash
mkdir my-new-folder
```

Check that the directory is there using `ls` (which is used for <strong>l</strong>i<strong>s</strong>ting files and directories)


```bash
ls
```

And then navigate _into_ that directory using `cd` (which is used for <strong>c</strong>hanging <strong>d</strong>irectories)

```bash
cd my-new-folder
```

You can also go "back up one level" by using the special case `..` (which always refers to "the folder one level up")

```bash
cd ..
```

Go ahead and try it:

- Create a new folder called `ember-workshop` with terminal commands
- Navigate into your newly created folder using the terminal
- List the folder's content. What do you see in your shell window?


Did you also know that you can copy-paste any of the commands from this tutorial into your terminal window?

Hit Control + C (Windows + Linux) or Cmd + C (Mac) while highlighting the command to copy it and use Control + V (or Cmd + V on Mac) while focussing your terminal window to paste it. This is especially useful for long commands that might take a while to type out.

Some terminals have always had problems with copy and pasting into them, so if the shortcuts above don't seem to work then try right clicking in the terminal to see if let's you paste
