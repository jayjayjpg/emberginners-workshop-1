# An Intro to JavaScript

## What is JavaScript used for?

JavaScript is a programming language that empowers its users to build things on the web! What does building things on the web specifically mean? To understand this better, let's take a look what a browser, a program like Chrome or Firefox, actually does:

## What do Browsers Do?

A web browser (commonly referred to as a browser) is a software application for accessing information on the World Wide Web. Each individual web page, image, and video is identified by a url (e.g. `http://www.simplabs.com`) enabling browsers to retrieve these resources from a web server and display them on the user's device - which is your computer or your smartphone.

Your browser is an application that can parse - which means, read and interpret - information via different types of data formats stored in files. As a reference, your Microsoft Office or OpenOffice editor is an application that can parse information that is stored in the form of `.doc` or `odt` files. In a similar fashion, certain types of files can be parsed by browsers which are mostly `.html` (HTML), `.css` (CSS) and `.js` (JavaScript) files.

In the scope of this workshop we won't be able to take a deeper look into the former two, HTML and CSS, themselves. If you want to learn more about them after the workshop, feel encouraged to learn more about them through web courses or user groups in your area.

Instead we will focus on JavaScript and how we can use and create `.js` files, that can be run in the browser so that it will display our first web application that we're going to build today!

## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a dynamic programming language that runs in the browser. This means that your browser (e.g. Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer) can not only read JavaScript files,
but is also able to carry them out. A JavaScript file is any text file with a `.js` filename ending and text content which follows the JavaScript language syntax.

In the following section you will learn more about how you can make JavaScript code run in your own browser.

### Running JavaScript directly in your browser

In the following section we will see how we can run JavaScript code directly in our browser. We will not require any text editor as such and we won't need to create any JavaScript files beforehand.
Instead, we will use a **tool** that is pre-installed for us in any browser to write JavaScript and run it subsequently.

#### Exercise 1a: Showing a message box

- Open Chrome (it's best to use chrome so we're all using the same thing)
- right click anywhere in the window, select "Inspect"
- click on the "Console" tab
- Type into the window right next to the small arrow: `alert("Hello World!")` and hit Enter.

- Type into the window right next to the small arrow `console.log("Hello World!")` and hit Enter. What happens now?
